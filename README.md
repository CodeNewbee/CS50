#My go at CS50

This is my attempt at finishing online version of Harvards CS50 introduction to computer science course.


##pset1
This is the first problem set for CS50. It introduces programming language C, and includes 5 relatively simple tasks in C language.
[here is the code](https://github.com/CodeNewbee/CS50/tree/master/pset1)

##pset2
Slightly more complicated tasks, again in C: I had to write code that uses caesers and vigenere cipher.
[here is the code](https://github.com/CodeNewbee/CS50/tree/master/pset2/)

##pset3
A bit more fun task: first, I had to implement key functions for fifteen.c, which is a command-line game based on fifteen puzzle 
game, second and third task were implementing a search and sorting algorithm in helpers.c
[here is the code](https://github.com/CodeNewbee/CS50/tree/master/pset3/)

##pset4
For me this was one of the hardest, but at the same time the most fun one. Firstly I had to make a C programm which removes red
color from an BMP file so that I can see the picture clearly (It was covered with some useless red pixels), after that I had to
make code that resizes BMP file, in essence a bit familiar to the first task. The fun part was the last challenge - making a program
that recovers deleted JPEG files from "deleted" memory. It took me a good while, but it was a really cool task :)
[here is the code] (https://github.com/CodeNewbee/CS50/tree/master/pset4)

##pset5
Problem set 5 was also amongst the hardest, but for me it produced less problems than pset4, even though it was more complicated.
The task was to make a simple spelling checker. The spelling checker works by searching trough dictionary of words and checks if
it matches any of them, if not it counts it as a misspelled word. [here is the code](https://github.com/CodeNewbee/CS50/tree/master/pset5)

##pset6
For me, this was the most boring problem set. All coding happened in one file, server.c which basicly was a webserver, written in C,
and I had to implement some functions so that it works. [here is the code](https://github.com/CodeNewbee/CS50/tree/master/pset6/)

##pset7
A very interesting problem set, since I had not done anything with PHP or MySQL before. I had to implement
functionallity for a primitive stock trading website. Actually making something graphic and functional felt
very self-rewarding. [here is the code](https://github.com/CodeNewbee/CS50/tree/master/pset7/)
